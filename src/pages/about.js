    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I'm a junior engineer.</p>

    <p>
      When I set my mind to something I work very hard to achieve it. Whether it
      be building a career as a physiotherapist in Brazil, coming to Sydney to
      learn English or my current focus of reskilling as a Software Developer.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have embedded myself in the Sydney tech industry by attending meetups,
      enrolling in the LevelUp program at ThoughtWorks and studying the Software
      Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love the ever-changing nature of this industry and that I have chosen a
      career path where I will always be learning. I also love the diversity of
      the tech community - I feel like I have found my people!
